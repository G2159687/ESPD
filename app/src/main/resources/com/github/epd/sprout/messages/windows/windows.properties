windows.wndstory.sewers=The Dungeon lies right beneath the City, its upper levels actually constitute the City's sewer system.\n\nAs dark energy has crept up from below the usually harmless sewer creatures have become more and more dangerous. The city sends guard patrols down here to try and maintain safety for those above, but they are slowly failing.\n\nThis place is dangerous, but at least the evil magic at work here is weak.
windows.wndstory.prison=Many years ago a prison was built here to house dangerous criminals. Tightly regulated and secure, convicts from all over the land were brought here to serve time.\n\nBut soon dark miasma started to creep from below, twisting the minds of guard and prisoner alike.\n\nIn response to the mounting chaos, the city sealed off the entire prison. Nobody knows what became of those who were left for dead within these walls...
windows.wndstory.caves=The caves, which stretch down under the abandoned prison, are sparcely populated. They lie too deep to be exploited by the City and they are too poor in minerals to interest the dwarves. In the past there was a trade outpost somewhere here on the route between these two states, but it has perished since the decline of Dwarven Metropolis. Only omnipresent gnolls and subterranean animals dwell here now.
windows.wndstory.city=Dwarven Metropolis was once the greatest of dwarven city-states. In its heyday the mechanized army of dwarves has successfully repelled the invasion of the old god and his demon army. But it is said, that the returning warriors have brought seeds of corruption with them, and that victory was the beginning of the end for the underground kingdom.
windows.wndstory.halls=In the past these levels were the outskirts of Metropolis. After the costly victory in the war with the old god dwarves were too weakened to clear them of remaining demons. Gradually demons have tightened their grip on this place and now it's called Demon Halls.\n\nVery few adventurers have ever descended this far...
windows.wndstory.s1=I have devised a method for creating extra-planar spaces in which to hide my belongings.\n\n Oddly, strange breeds of sheep have materialized in these spaces. Maybe I can use these ovine denizens to my advantage. \n\n-Otiluke, 1345 LP.
windows.wndstory.s2=Having mastered the elements required for creating my spaces, I am now set out to build a grand fortress in which to hide my valuables. \n\n-Otiluke, 1348 LP.
windows.wndstory.s3=My powers have grown stronger since I created my first space. I find myself able to alter time and position in ways I have never thought possible.\n\n My activities have created ripples in the magical ethosphere. On clear days I am able to capture echoes of some disturbance focused on my presence. \n\n-Otiluke, 1355 LP.
windows.wndstory.s4=My efforts to stop my pursuers have only slowed their progress.\n\nI am now remembering the strange spaces where I hid some of my valuables centuries ago. The items themselves are no longer of importance to me, but the source of the odd power generating the sheep eluded me for years.\n\n Perhaps this power, once illuminated, will be a source of succor. I fear I have little options left. \n\n-Otiluke, 1617 LP.
windows.wndstory.s5=A small space carved out of the fabric of time serves well to keep me replenished. I have been able to rest here and store some of my items to relieve my burden.
windows.wndstory.s6="With what little power I have left I have momentarily bested Zot and obtained his orb of power.\n\n Although its power is warded against me, I can transpose objects from this world into the heart of the orb.\n\n I hear a rushing of power in the distance... Zot approaches!\n\n My last act will be to return to Dolyahaven, my birthplace and seal this script into the orb.\n\n Zot will need to break the orb and source of his power to follow me.\n\n -Otiluke, 1999 LP.
windows.wndstory.s7=You gaze into the Palantir you are sucked into the power of the sphere.\n\nYou sense a great evil lurking nearby.
